> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- Testing the web app was a great hands-on experience. I got to explore how the site works and try to find bugs in real-world features. It helped me get a better feel for what actual testing is like. It was nice that I had a template for this testing project, because I would have found it quite hard to create it by my shelf from scratch.
     

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
I started by checking out the features I needed to test. 
Then, I wrote and tested simple cases, making sure to include steps for the expected results for each. I also used variables where I could to make things more reusable. 
This template made it  easy to stay organized.
    

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
I have heard about Jira before, but have not actually tested anything before this course.


## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
I used Visual Studio Code for this assignment, because I have used it lately a lot.


     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
First this assignment or project felt bit confusing, but when I followed the step-by-step video guide from teacher and instructions it appeared to be easy to follow the examples.


## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
I have used GitHub before in various courses in Laurea. Propably like 5 courses and most recetly in Mobile App-course.
 

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
If I had to automate these tests, I’d go with Selenium. Selenium is well-suited for web apps, and it’s a popular choice with lots of support online. It’s reliable, easy and gives you full control over what you’re testing.



## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
From my search, I found that companies are looking for skills like:
    -Selenium, Cypress, and Test Automation Frameworks
    -Git and version control
    -Programming languages like Python, Java, or JavaScript
    -API testing tools (Postman, RestAssured)
    -Agile experience



## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
To keep improving, I’d focus on technical stuff: Improve my skills with Visual Code, Git, and learning more about Automation Testing (Selenium, Cypress) and also API Testing.
Soft skills for being a better team player, working with agile teams, improving my problem-solving and communication skills, and getting better at attention to detail. I would say most likely the technical stuff is the most issue, I have already experience with working in different kind of projects and teams and I have a good visual eye. Coding and technical stuff is what I need to improve.


## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
The project helped me take what I’ve learned and apply it. Testing real features made the theory more useful and gave me a better understanding of how testing works in real projects. It was also cool to learn how to write test cases and track bugs. 
I think the content was solid and easy to follow and extra helpfull was that for once we had a good guide and video tutorial provided by teacher which helped a lot. Usually courses what I have studied has only a bunch of youtube links etc. and outdated video-tutorials, which makes studying and learning hard. 
I truly enjoyed this course and I think it gave me basic-knowledge about testing and I could think about taking more advanced software-testing course in future.
