
## Summary (Summarize the bug encountered concisely)
The text label for the "Create blank project" button on the GitLab project creation page has a typo, where "blank" is mistakenly written as "black." This is a cosmetic issue that could confuse users.


## Steps to reproduce     
1. Go to the GitLab project creation page: https://gitlab.com/projects/new#blank_project.
2. Locate the button with the text "Create black project".
3. Observe that the word "blank" is spelled incorrectly as "black."
   

## What is the current bug behavior?
The button text reads "Create black project" instead of "Create blank project". This may cause confusion for users trying to create a blank project. If they are beginners or trying to follow a step-by-step guide.
     

## What is the expected correct behavior?
The button text should say "Create blank project" to properly represent intended functionality of creating a blank project.
